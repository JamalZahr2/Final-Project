# Final-Project
What this program achieves:

A Array formatted music player with mute, forward/rewind, next, back, stop, and volume up & down functions
Has a pause/play function for any song
Reads mp3 files in music folder and lists them in console using java language

What should be added:

Code that would auto-assign the index and values to any .mp3 file added to the music folder and allow for "Drag and Drop" feature
Defining Absolute pathway using relative pathways to help localize code
Resolve the bugs surrounding the .length function for both loop and 'Song Stop' modes
Song Meta Data to display information about the song in console such as Author, Length, etc
To build your own playlist and have the program save the songlist the user would make (.json storage)

What I should've attempted to look into:

More general understanding with the java coding languaage and mainly Strings
Ways to avoid conflicts between class types amongst files such as AudioPlayer =/= File
How to work with List Arrays for the functionality of the auto assign functions ( Song[CurrentSong += 1] )

(Side note: I may or may not have spent the entirity of my time researching the code hence why I never ended up doing the bug fixes around the code)
